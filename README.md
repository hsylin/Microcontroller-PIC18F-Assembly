# PIC18F Microcontroller Assembly Programming

In this course, I delved into the hardware architecture of the **PIC18F4520 microcontroller** and gained hands-on experience in low-level Assembly language programming. The laboratory sessions emphasized practical manipulation of the microcontroller and its peripheral devices, allowing me to build a range of embedded applications. Through these exercises, I developed a deeper understanding of microcontroller operations and how to integrate various components to solve real-world problems in embedded systems.

For details on the specific lab assignments and my implementation code, please refer to the corresponding folders in this repository.
## Final Project: Computer Numerical Control(CNC) Plotter
This project showcases a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Plotter, designed and built to translate digital designs into precise physical drawings on a flat surface. The CNC Plotter uses stepper motors, a microcontroller, and various control algorithms to accurately move a pen in two dimensions.

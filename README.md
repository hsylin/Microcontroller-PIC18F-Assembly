# PIC18F Microcontroller Assembly Programming
In this course, we delved into the hardware architecture of the PIC18F microcontroller and gained hands-on experience in low-level Assembly language programming. The laboratory sessions emphasized practical manipulation of the microcontroller and its peripheral devices, allowing us to build a range of embedded applications. Through these exercises, I developed a deeper understanding of microcontroller operations and how to integrate various components to solve real-world problems in embedded systems.

For details on the specific lab assignments and my implementation code, please refer to the corresponding folders in this repository. Each folder contains the assignment requirements and the accompanying code solutions.

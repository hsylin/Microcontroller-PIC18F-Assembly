# PIC18F Microcontroller Assembly Programming

In this course, I delved into the hardware architecture of the **PIC18F microcontroller** and gained hands-on experience in low-level Assembly language programming. The laboratory sessions emphasized practical manipulation of the microcontroller and its peripheral devices, allowing me to build a range of embedded applications. Through these exercises, I developed a deeper understanding of microcontroller operations and how to integrate various components to solve real-world problems in embedded systems.

For details on the specific lab assignments and my implementation code, please refer to the corresponding folders in this repository.
